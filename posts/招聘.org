Each point i has the following property, q_{1}[i], c_{1}[i], q_{2}[i], c_{2}[i]>0, b_{1}[i]. b_{2}[i];

b is binary,
 And b_{1}[i] + b_{2}[i] <= 1;
 \sum b_{1}[i] = n1, and \sum b_{2}[i] = n2;
Maximize
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum b_{1}[i] * q_{1}[i] + b_{2}[i] * q_{2}[i]}{\sum b_{1}[i] * c_{1}[i] + b_{2}[i] * c_{2}[i]}
\end{equation}
 

* Solution
 binary search the ratio, and then DP. Since given ratio, it becomes 0-1 bag problem.
Following 
[[i don't know the link][zzz]] 's idea: Sorting the pair first.
Use f[tot_{n}][num_{2}] instead of  f[num_{1}][num_{2}]

f[tot_n][j]: if tot_n - j <= n1, then it means the optimal value assigning exactly tot_n - j people to project 1 and j people to project 2.
else it means assigning n1 people to project 1 and j people to project 2.
